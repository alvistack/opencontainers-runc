Description: Tool for spawning and running OCI containers
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the
 OCI specification. It is designed to be as minimal as possible, and is
 the workhorse of Docker. It was originally designed to be a replacement
 for LXC within Docker, and has grown to become a separate project
 entirely. This package is a fork of the "runc' package, specifically for
 cri-o.
